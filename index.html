                <p>Photographs, identity documents, a copy of a birth certificate, an item of clothing, their favourite gardening tools, their childhood home,
                    their primary school, their children – these are the only reminders
                    that they existed, that they lived, that they are missed.</p>
                    <p>Each piece of this puzzle represents a migrant from Zimbabwe who
                        went missing during his or her migration journey. Families of missing
                        migrants will not forget them.</p>
                        <p>Time does not heal, answers do. Families are not alone with their
                            loss and suffering. This puzzle symbolizes their togetherness in
                            their search for their missing loved ones. Like, this incomplete
                            puzzle, for the families, the search
                            continues.</p>
